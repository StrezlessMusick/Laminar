## New Airstream Features


### Mapping StrictSignal-s

You can now `mapLazy` strict signals similarly to how you can `zoomLazy` into a Var, **and get back another StrictSignal without needing an owner**:

```scala
val formVar = Var(Form(...))
val formSignal: StrictSignal[Form] = formVar.signal 
val fieldSignal: StrictSignal[FieldValue] = formSignal.mapLazy(_.field) // Still a StrictSignal!
    
fieldSignal.now() // FieldValue
```

This helps manage more of your state without messing with owners / subscriptions and observable composition.

Q: Nikita, these types and method names don't make sense anymore.

A: Yes. Just as with `zoomLazy`, we are evolving core Airstream capabilities within the 17.x line, which means that I can't just rename the type `StrictSignal`, and can't make the old `map` method return a more specific subtype of `Signal`. I plan to clean this up and expand the owner-less functionality in the next major version, so please bear with the _lazy_ naming for now.



### Splitting Observables by pattern match ("by type")

You know how in Airstream you can `split` a `Signal[Seq[Item]]` into N individual `Signal[Item]`-s, one for every unique item, identified by a key like `_.id` â€“ to efficiently render it in Laminar? Well, [Hoang Dinh](https://github.com/hollanddm) has implemented a similar transformation, but for splitting an `Observable[ADT]` â€“ where `ADT` is e.g. a sealed trait with several subclasses â€“ into N `Signal[Subtype]`, one for each subtype.

Take a look at a very simple example:

```scala
sealed trait Page
object HomePage extends Page
object LoginPage extends Page
case class UserPage(userId: Int) extends Page

val pageSignal: Signal[Page] = ??? // router.currentPageSignal

val elementSignal: Signal[HtmlElement] =
  pageSignal
    .splitMatchOne
    .handleValue(HomePage) {
      div(h1("Home page"))
    }
    .handleValue(LoginPage) {
      div(h1("Login page"))
    }
    .handleType[UserPage] { (initialUserPage, userPageSignal) =>
      div(
        h1("User #", text <-- userPageSignal.map(_.id))
      )
    }
    .toSignal
```

Under the hood, this is equivalent to something like:

```scala
val elementSignal: Signal[HtmlElement] =
  pageSignal
    .map {
      // condition => (handlerIndex, handlerInput)
      case HomePage => (0, ())
      case LoginPage => (1, ())
      case up: UserPage => (2, up)
    }
    .splitOne(key = _._1) { (..., ..., ...) =>
      // Return one of the div-s, properly wired and precisely typed
    }
```

You may recognize that this looks similar to [Waypoint](https://github.com/raquo/Waypoint)'s `SplitRender` functionality, and you'll be right â€“`handleValue` is similar to Waypoint's `collectStatic` and `handleType` is similar to `collectSignal` â€“ but, importantly, Waypoint's implementation has several problems:
- For `collectSignal`, it relied on `ClassTag` for type matching, so it isn't super safe around generic type params
- It could not warn you about non-exhaustive matches

The new implementation is macro-based, and it works by rebuilding / rearranging the `case` statements you provide into a single `match` block, so you get all the features and guarantees of regular Scala pattern matching.

Yes, this new functionality is actually more generalized than just matching by type or value: you can generate arbitrary case statements using `handleCase` (not shown here) â€“ **see the [new documentation section](https://github.com/raquo/airstream?tab=readme-ov-file#splitting-with-pattern-match) for that.**

**But that's not all!**

You can split-by-pattern-match not only an `Observable[ADT]`, but also an `Observable[Seq[ADT]]` â€“ so if you have an observable with a list of items, and you need a separate render callback for each item, **and** each item in the collection can be one of several types, each requiring different rendering â€“ yes, you can do that now, all in one go, with `splitMatchSeq`, for example:

```scala
trait Item { val id: String }
case class Stock(ticker: String, currency: String, value: Double) {
  override val id: String = ticker
}
case class FxRate(currency1: String, currency2: String, rate: Double) {
  override val id: String = currency1 + "-" + currency2 
}

val itemsSignal: Signal[Seq[Item]] = ???
val elementsSignal: Signal[Seq[HtmlElement]] =
  modelsSignal
    .splitMatchSeq(_.id)
    .handleType[Stock] { (initialStock, stockSignal) =>
      div(
        initialStock.id + ": ",
        text <-- stockSignal.map(_.value),
        " " + initialStock.currency
      )
    }
    .handleType[FxRate] { (initialRate, rateSignal) =>
      div(initialRate.id, ": ", text <-- rateSignal.map(_.rate))
    }
    .toSignal

children <-- elementsSignal // in Laminar
```

I am super pumped that such advanced Observable transformations are now a part of Airstream core. This is the first usage of macros in Airstream, and it's a good use case for them. Huge thanks to Hoang for working through all this!

While the rest of Airstream is cross compiled for both Scala 2.13 and Scala 3, these new macro-based features are for Scala 3 only. We do not plan to port this new functionality to Scala 2.13 as we are not proficient in Scala 2 macros. In Scala 2.13, you can use Waypoint's general-purpose `SplitRender` functionality to similar effect (except for `splitMatchSeq`, which is not available).


### Local Storage Vars

[Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is a browser API that lets you persist data to a key-value client-side storage. This storage is shared between and is available to all tabs and frames from the same [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) within the same browser.

Airstream now offers persistent Vars backed by LocalStorage, accessed via `WebStorageVar.localStorage`, e.g.:

```scala
val showSidebarVar: WebStorageVar[Boolean] =
  WebStorageVar
    .localStorage(key = "showSidebar", syncOwner = None)
    .bool(default = true)
```

LocalStorage Vars can automatically sync their values between multiple browser tabs. See [live demo](https://demo.laminar.dev/app/integrations/localstorage). For details, see the [new documentation section](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/?tab=readme-ov-file#localstorage).

And yes, we support [SessionStorage](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/?tab=readme-ov-file#sessionstorage) too.


### More Var Features


#### Distinct Vars

The `distinct` operator (including all its [variations](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/?tab=readme-ov-file#distinction-operators) like `distinctByFn`) is now available on Vars. For Vars, it filters both reads and writes, making it easy to create a state Var that only updates when its content actually changes to a different value: `val formVar = Var(initial = Form.empty).distinct`.

For implementation details, see the [new documentation section](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/?tab=readme-ov-file#vardistinct).


#### Isomorphic Transformations

You could already `zoomLazy` into a Var to e.g. focus on a particular field, and now you can also `bimap` the Var to apply an isomorphic transformation, for example:

```scala
val fooVar: Var[Foo] = Var(Foo(123, "yo"))
val jsonVar: Var[String] = fooVar.bimap(getThis = Foo.toJson)(getParent = Foo.fromJson)
```

See the [new documentation section](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/?tab=readme-ov-file#varbimap).


#### Var splitByIndex and splitOption

These useful `split` variations were ported from Signals to Var-s by [Paul-Henri Froidmont](https://github.com/phfroidmont) â€“ thanks!


#### You Can Now Subclass SourceVar

This lets you create Var-s with custom public methods, for example the new WebStorageVar is [implemented](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/raquo/airstream/web/WebStorageVar.scala) that way.


## Small Laminar Fixes

- Fix: Avoid instantiating some internal comment nodes unless / until they are needed.



## New Waypoint Features

- **Build: Waypoint depends on Laminar now (not just Airstream)**
  - New: `navigateTo` example method from the docs is now available on `Router` â€“ it provides a convenient modifier for Laminar elements that sets a reasonable onClick handler and href on the element. [Documentation](https://github.com/raquo/waypoint?tab=readme-ov-file#responding-to-link-clicks)
  - Unlike the previous example in the docs, it does not reset scroll position â€“ do that yourself by observing `currentPageSignal`
  - _**Migration:** `Router` constructor is now a single argument list, `popStateEvents` and `owner` now have default values._
- **New: Total and Partial route types, to improve type-safety for the total routes â€“ by [ArtÅ«ras Å lajus](https://github.com/arturaz/) â€“ thank you!**
  - New: `route.argsFromPageTotal` and `route.relativeUrlForPage` available on `Route.Total` subtype of `Route`.
  - _**Migration:** If `Route.static` complains that it can't find `ValueOf` for your page type, it's because your type is not a singleton like `object LoginPage`, so we can't make a total route for it. Use `Route.staticPartial` instead._
- New: `Router.replacePageTitle` â€“ useful when you need to fetch data before you know what the page title should be.
- Fix: `SplitRender.signal` should be a lazy val, not def.



## Scala.js & Laminar giter8 Template

A few people asked for a bare-bones Laminar giter8 template â€“ and here it is:  [raquo/scalajs.g8](https://github.com/raquo/scalajs.g8) â€“ and you can actually opt-out of Laminar here, so it's good for plain Scala.js too. The main value here is the quick sbt + Vite setup that gets you to writing Laminar apps in a moment.

Scala.js has its own [vite.g8](https://github.com/scala-js/vite.g8/). Compared to that, my template adds Laminar as well as my own preferred setup for CSS (both are optional). I may add more optional features like TailwindCSS setup later.



## Buildkit & Scalafmt Config

As the number of my open source projects keeps growing, I get more tired of copying various build-related things across them. Sbt plugins are ok to share Scala code, but I've recently wanted to add scalafmt configs to all my projects, and did not find an easy way to do that.

So, I published my standard scalafmt config in [raquo/scalafmt-config](https://github.com/raquo/scalafmt-config/) â€“ it captures the prevailing Laminar & Airstream formatting style, and should work well for both Scala 2 and Scala 3. Personally I think it's a better starting point than some of the defaults I've seen, but of course it's a matter of personal preference.

To distribute this shared config to my open source projects, I made [raquo/buildkit](https://github.com/raquo/buildkit/) â€“ a tiny project that you add as a compile-time dependency to your build. At the moment, all it can do is download (and cache locally) any URL-versioned file into your project. You can then `include` this now-local `.scalafmt.shared.conf` file from your main `.scalafmt.conf` file, and live happily thereafter.

The minimalistic design of this downloader is intended for low-overhead sharing of non-source files such as configs and assets. I don't want to spend the time publishing such things to sbt or npm â€“ I'm happy to just use Github URLs and version tags for this.

Eventually I would like to explore this kind of low-overhead publishing further, because I feel that our community could benefit from reducing the barrier to sharing e.g. manually written Scala.js facade definitions, but for now, this is just a small tool, mostly for my own consumption, similarly to [scala-dom-testutils](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-testutils).
