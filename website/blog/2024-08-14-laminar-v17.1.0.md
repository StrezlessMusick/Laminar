## News


### Scala.js & Laminar in Healthcare

The HeartAI team are using Scala.js and Laminar to develop their Critical Care Informatics System for CALHN, a major health network in South Australia. A key feature of this system, [ICU ward and bed dashboards](https://heartai.net/docs/projects/calhn-critical-care-informatics-system/icu-ward-and-bed-boards/), support critical care workers with high-quality health information about ICU patients. _"Scala.js and Laminar have provided a scalable way to build robust applications in the complex health domain."_ â€“ says Lukah Dykes, Managing Director at HeartAI.

## New Airstream Features


### Splitting Var-s

You could always `split` a `Signal[Collection[A]]` into N individual `Signal[A]`, but now you can also directly split a `Var[Collection[A]]` into N individual `Var[A]` that are linked to the original `Var[Collection[A]]`.

For example, in the example below, the user's name in both `userVar` and `usersVar` is updated when you type the new name into the input text box.

```scala
case class User(id: String, name: String)
val usersVar = Var[List[User]](???)

div(
  usersVar.split(_.id)((userId, initial, userVar) => {
    div(
      s"User ${userId}: ",
      input(
        value <-- userVar.signal.map(_.name),
        onInput.mapToValue --> { newName =>
          userVar.update(_.copy(name = newName))
        }
      )
    )
  })
)
```

Previously in this situation, you would have needed to update `usersVar` manually by finding the user with `id == userId` and updating the list with the new user at that index. Now this is done behind the scenes just by updating `userVar`.

Also, in addition to `split`, you can also use `splitMutate` on Vars that contain **mutable** collections. As the name implies, it works the same as regular `Var.split`, except that when you update `userVar`, it would **mutate** the collection in `usersVar` instead of creating a copy of it as is usually done with immutable collections. This may be more efficient when working with very large mutable collections.


### Zoom into a Var without needing an Owner

Airstream has had the `zoom` method to create derived vars for a while now: `Var.zoom(a => b)((a, b) => a)(implicit owner)`. Unfortunately, that method required an `Owner`, which made using it rather annoying.

Recently, [@KitLangton](https://github.com/kitlangton) has [figured out](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/issues/119) that this Owner isn't really needed, and so we now have a new `zoomLazy(a => b)((a, b) => a)` method that does not require an `Owner`, and otherwise works pretty much the same. One catch is that your `zoomIn` (`a => b`) function is now called lazily, so it shouldn't have side effects. In practice that shouldn't be a problem because this function typically just selects some field from an object.

This small change should help a lot with ergonomics of local state management.

We use the `zoomLazy` name to stay binary-compatible with 17.0.0 in this release, but in the next major release, `zoomLazy` will be renamed to `zoom`, and the old `zoom` will be renamed to `zoomStrict` and deprecated.


### Small stuff

* New: `.not` alias to the `.invert` operator on observables of booleans
* The `Splittable` trait has two new methods: `foreach` and `findUpdate`. **Migration:** if you have custom instances of `Splittable` for non-standard collection types, make sure to review the default implementations of those methods for efficiency.


## Waypoint bug fix

* Waypoint upgraded to URL-DSL 6.0.2:
  * Fixed a case with `listParam` where matching failed if no query parameters were provided in the URL, whereas it should have matched as `Nil`. Thanks, [@arturaz](https://github.com/arturaz)!
